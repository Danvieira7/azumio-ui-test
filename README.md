## Azumio Test
- This is an attempt to replicate a design provided by the Azumio hiring team, using only HTML and CSS. Only a mobile view of the design was provided, therefore the replica should be viewed through the developer tools as an Iphone X.
- Used HTML5 Best Practices with as many semantic tags as possible to make it easier for accessibility applications to access the page.
- I used a mobile first approach to style the replica, making it easier to cover every screen variation.

### Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
